# Rent A Car
"Rent A Car" is a car rental project developed by Neel using ASP.NET Core MVC, Angular, and SQL Server 2008 R2. The application has two main sections: one for users and one for administrators.

Users can register on the portal, log in with their credentials, book a car, and make a payment to complete the booking. If a user books a car but does not make a payment, the booking will not be finalized. In addition to booking and paying for a car, users can also view their booking and transaction history, as well as cancel their bookings if needed.

Administrators, on the other hand, have the ability to add new cars to the rental inventory, view all bookings and payment transactions, and cancel bookings as needed.

Overall, this Angular application was built using Angular, Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017, and SQL Server 2008 R2 Express Edition. It aims to streamline the car rental process by allowing users to easily browse available vehicles, make bookings, and make payments online. With the ability to view and manage bookings, as well as add and remove cars from the rental inventory, administrators can efficiently manage the rental business through the use of this application.
